# Protocol :: CODE_RECONSTRUCTION_SIM v1.1

## Anomaly Source: Unstable Code Stream

**Intercepted Data:**

Main data stream fragmented. Cascading code constructs detected. Operator input required for reconstruction sequence. Simulation protocols active.

**Directive:**

Achieve maximum horizontal data line integrity within the active grid. Integrate descending code blocks to purge corruption. Prevent construct accumulation exceeding grid apex threshold.

**Interface Inputs:**

*   `←` / `↑`: Rotate Construct (Anti/Clockwise)
*   `→`: Shift Horizontal (+)
*   `↓`: Accelerate Descent
*   `P`: Suspend Simulation Field

**Evaluation:**

Success measured by completed data lines. Failure results in irreversible stream corruption.
